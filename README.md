# PomodoroApp
This is an application for the Pomodoro Technique of time management. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals called "pomodoro", with short breaks in between each interval, and longer ones after so many pomodori. The idea is that this structure can help users stay focused and productive while avoiding burnout and fatigue.

The application should provide a timer that users can set to (the default) 25 minutes, along with a countdown clock that indicates when the current pomodoro is over. After each pomodoro, the application provides a short break period of around 5 minutes, during which the user can rest and recharge. Once the break is over, the user can start another pomodoro and repeat the cycle.

In addition to basic timer functionality, this Pomodoro application offers additional features such as customizable intervals, the ability to track progress and productivity, and the option to customize the length of the break period, and notify the user when the pomodoro and break is over.
